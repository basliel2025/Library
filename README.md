# Library

A simple web-based library application that allows users to add, view, and manage a collection of books. Built with semantic HTML, modular CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this project demonstrates dynamic DOM manipulation, form handling, and responsive layout techniques.

## Features

- Add new books with title, author, page count, and read status  
- Display all books in a responsive grid layout  
- Toggle read status with intuitive messaging  
- Clean and maintainable code using object constructors and unique IDs  
- Styled with warm wood-inspired design for a cozy reading vibe

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for semantic structure  
- CSS3 for layout and styling  
- JavaScript for interactivity and logic  
- UUID generation via `crypto.randomUUID()` for unique book tracking
